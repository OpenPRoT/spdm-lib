    Update caliptra-sw and caliptra-ss; SPDM updates (#232)
    
    This requires some small adaptation to the PCR quotes since those
    commands were split.
    
    The recovery flow has changed slightly in Caliptra so that its device
    status stays in state 3 (recovery mode) except when activating.

    hw/model: FPGA now mostly boots Caliptra (#211)
    
    There's a problem with the MCU -> Caliptra mailbox interface that we are
    debugging, but this gets through most of the boot process.
    
    I updated `caliptra-sw` to point to the latest commit and did some
    related cleanup (new Rust version so some clippy fixes were necessary).
    
    I also did some more cleanup of the FPGA model to use Tock registers
    that were automatically generated from RDL and then did some manual
    tuning.
